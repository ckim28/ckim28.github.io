        <h1>About Fall</h1>
            <p>I like fall because the weather is nice. <br>
            I enjoy spending time with my family on Thanksgiving. <br>
            I love eating my mom's delicious homemade Thanksgiving dinner.<br>
            Dressing up on Halloween with my friends and 'Trick or Treating' is one of my favorite things about fall too.<br>
            It is relaxing to sit at home, watch a movie and drink some hot cocoa on the couch.<br>
            The vibrant colors of the leaves are pretty.<br>
            I love fall festivals like apple picking and going to the pumpkin patch. <br>
            I love spending time with family, especially since having a break during school is really nice!<br>
